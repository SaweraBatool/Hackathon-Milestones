# Hackathon-Milestones
This repository documents my progress in building a dynamic resume builder as part of a hackathon project using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. The resume builder is designed with a clean &amp; user-friendly interface. Users can fill out a form with personal details, skills, and experiences, and see their resume generate in real-time .
